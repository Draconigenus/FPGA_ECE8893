# Overview of Labs and Final Projects

## Labs (30 Points Total)
The labs are individual assignments designed to build your skills in HLS and smart architecture design. Each lab requires:
- Submission of source code.
- Performance metrics submitted to a leaderboard for ranking (if applicable).
- A well-written report explaining your implementation and findings.

### **Lab 1: Basic Practice of Vitis HLS**
- **Objective**: Familiarize yourself with the HLS design flow.
- **Notes**: Simple introductory lab; no leaderboard ranking.
- **Points**: 10

### **Lab 2: Implementation of an Attention Layer**
- **Objective**: Implement an attention layer based on a given reference.
- **Requirements**: Apply advanced HLS techniques such as parallelism and pipelining.
- **Points**: 10

### **Lab 3: Sparse Matrix Multiplication**
- **Objective**: Design an efficient sparse matrix multiplication architecture.
- **Requirements**: Go beyond basic HLS usage by applying smart architecture design principles.
- **Points**: 10
